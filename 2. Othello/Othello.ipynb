    "# Othello\n",
    "\n",
    "Othello is a turn-based two-player strategy board game. The players take turns placing pieces, one player white and the other player black, on an 8x8 board in such a way that captures some of the opponent's pieces, with the goal of finishing the game with more pieces of their color on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every move must capture one or more of the opponent's pieces. To capture, player A places a piece adjacent to one of player B's pieces so that there is a straight line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of adjacent pieces that begins with one of player A's pieces, continues with one or more of player B's pieces, and ends with one of player A's pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Black places a piece on square (5, 1), he will capture all of Black's pieces (5, 1) and (5, 6):\n",

    "For more information about the game (which is also known as Reversi) including detailed rules, see the entry on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). Additionally, this implementation doesn't take into account some tournament-style Othello details, such as game time limits and a different indexing scheme.\n",

    "We will implement representations for the board and pieces and the mechanics of playing a game. We will then explore several game-playing strategies. There is a simple command-line program provided for playing against the computer or comparing two strategies.\n",

    "## Board Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent the board as a 100-element list, which includes each square on the board as well as the outside edge. Each consecutive sublist of ten elements represents a single row, and each list element stores a piece. An initial board contains four pieces in the center:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "     ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n",
    "     ? . . . . . . . . ?\n",
    "     ? . . . . . . . . ?\n",
    "     ? . . . . . . . . ?\n",
    "     ? . . . o @ . . . ?\n",
    "     ? . . . @ o . . . ?\n",
    "     ? . . . . . . . . ?\n",
    "     ? . . . . . . . . ?\n",
    "     ? . . . . . . . . ?\n",
    "     ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation has two useful properties:\n",
    "1. Square (m, n) can be accessed as `board[m][n]`. This avoids the need to write functions that convert between square locations and list indexes.\n",
    "2. Operations involving bounds checking are slightly simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outside edge is marked `?`, empty squares are `.`, black is `@`, and white is `o`. The black and white pieces represent the two players."
